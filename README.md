# A Generative and Mutational Approach for Synthesizing Bug-exposing Test Cases to Guide Compiler Fuzzing

COMFUZZ is a compiler fuzzing framework that combines generative and mutation techniques. Unlike prior work, COMFUZZ devotes to generating bug-exposing test cases by using historical test programs and performs focused testing by leveraging carefully designed bug-guided mutators.


## Docker Image

We provide [a code image](https://hub.docker.com/r/17604768805/comfuzz_env) and [a database image](https://hub.docker.com/r/17604768805/comfuzz_mysql) to [run "out of box"](#run). The required environment information can be found in REQUIREMENT.pdf.
We provide two ways to execute COMFUZZ: one is the [Quick Run](#1-quick-run); the other is to [Run Step-by-Step](#2-run-step-by-step) with the following scripts:

* step1_generator.py: the script that generates test programs according to historical test programs.
* step2_init.py: the script that builds the initial seed pool.
* step3_harness.py: the script that performs the differential testing on target compilers.
* step4_mutation.py: the script that mutates the interesting test cases for focused and intensive testing.
* step5_filter.py: the script that filters faulty and analyzed test cases.


## Setup

### 1 Load the Docker Images and Containers

1.1 Use the following commands to setup the environment variables to avoid timeout:

```
export DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=500
export COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=500
```

1.2 Using the following command to run the ```./docker-compose.yml``` for starting the docker image .

```
docker-compose up -d
```

1.3 Run the following command to import the docker container.

```
docker exec -it comfuzz_container /bin/bash
```


### 2 Additional Preliminaries
In order to save the importing time for the docker container, we compressed the configured JVM compilers and the pre-trained model for JVM and JS. You can run the following command in the `COMFUZZ/COMFUZZ_js` and `COMFUZZ/COMFUZZ_Java`.

```
python step0_preparation.py
```


## Run


### 1 Quick Run

##### 1.1 Testing JS Compilers

Use the following commands to test JS compilers:

```
cd COMFUZZ_js/workline
python main.py --enrich_limit_num=10 --loop_times=5 --clean_project
```

The parameter `enrich_limit_num` controls the number of tese cases in the seed pool (we set it to 10 for demonstration)ï¼Œ `loop_times` controls the iterative number during testing, and `clean_project` means cleaning the data in the database. We also provide many configurable parameters for customized execution. You can use `python3 main.py --help` to see what these parameters mean.


##### 1.2 Testing JVM Compilers
Use the following commands to test JVM compilers:

```
cd COMFUZZ_Java/workline
python main.py --clean_database=True --max_iterator=1
```

The parameter `--clean_database` controls cleaning the data in the database, and `--max_iterator` is used to specify the number of iteration testing.


### 2 Run Step-by-Step

You can also use the following step-by-step instructions to run COMFUZZ. **Note that the step-by-step instructions are the same for testing JS and JVM compilers.**

#### Step1. Generate Test Programs

This step will generate JS functions or Java methods and save them into `Table_Function`.

```
python step1_generator.py
```

Notably, when running in `COMFUZZ_Java`, the arguments `file_num` should meet the constraint: `file_num % 10 == 0`.

#### Step2. Build the Seed Pool

This step will assemble JS functions or Java methods from `Table_Function`, and save them into `Table_Testcase`.

```
python step2_init.py
```

#### Step3. Differential Testing

This step will apply differential testing on the selected test cases, (1)origin test cases generated by the trained model, (2)mutated test cases marked as interesting, or (3)mutated test cases marked as non-interesting. For JS, output results are stored in `Table_Result` and `Table_Suspicious_Result`; for Java, results of running `javac` are stored in `Table_javac_Result` and `Table_javac_Suspicious_Result`, and results of running `java` are stored in `Table_Result` and `Table_Suspicious_Result`.

```
python step3_harness.py
```

#### Step4. Mutation

This step will mutate test cases by two kinds of mutation methods: general-purpose mutation and bug-guided mutation. For those interesting test cases, COMFUZZ mutates them by bug-guided mutators and others by general-purpose mutators. Mutated test cases will be saved in `Table_Testcase`, and the column `Mutation_method` record the selected mutator id.

```
python step4_mutation.py
```

#### Step5. Filter

This step will filter suspicious test cases to avoid re-analysis of faulty and analyzed test cases.

```
python step5_filter.py
```
